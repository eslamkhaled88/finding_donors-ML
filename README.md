# finding_donors-ML
### project Overview
In order to assist CharityML (a hypothetical charitable organisation) in identifying persons most likely to give to their cause, you will use supervised learning techniques and an analytical mindset to data obtained for the US census in this assignment. To understand how the census data is recorded, you will first study the data. The data will then be modified using a number of transformations and preparation procedures so that it may be used. The data will then be used to compare a number of supervised learners of your choosing, and you'll decide which is most appropriate for the problem. After that, you'll refine the model you've chosen and offer it to CharityML as your answer. In order to determine how well the selected model predicts, you will finally look inside the model.
### Project Highlights
This project is intended to introduce you to the many supervised learning algorithms available in Sklearn and to provide you a way to assess how each model functions and performs given a particular type of data. Understanding precisely when and when a certain algorithm should be employed, as well as when one should be avoided, is crucial in machine learning.
### Things you will learn by completing this project:
* 1-How to recognise the situations when preprocessing is required and how to use it.
* 2-How to set a standard for a problem-solving approach.
* 3-What each supervised learning algorithm does in light of a particular dataset.
* 4-How to determine whether a potential solution model is suitable for the issue.
